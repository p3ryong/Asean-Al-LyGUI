            <p>Mother, I am eighteen this year
                and still without a husband.
                What, Mother, is your plan?
                The magpie brought two matchmakers
                and you threw them the challenge:
                not less than five full quan,
                five thousand areca nuts,
                five fat pigs,
                and five suits of clothes.
                
                Mother, I am twenty-three this year
                and still without a husband.
                What, Mother, dear, is your plan?
                The magpie brought two matchmakers
                and you threw them the challenge:
                not less than three full quan,
                three thousand areca nuts,
                three fat pigs,

                Mother, I am thirty-two this year
                and still without a husband.
                What, Mother, darling, is your plan?
                The magpie brought two matchmakers
                and you threw them the challenge:
                not less than one full quan,
                one thousand areca nuts,
                one fat dog this time,

                Mother, I am forty-three this year.
                Still without a husband.

            <h5>A School Boy’s Apology <br>by Le Thanh Huan</h5>
            <p>If sometimes I fall asleep in a lecture
                Or shout and scream as if alone
                Please forgive me, please don’t be angry
                For I have no place to play.
                
                I’m growing up I want to be a sailor
                I’m wishing for a giant arena, a stream
                I feel like yelling my life is beginning
                Every minute I want to hold tight to my dreams.
                
                But the fires of war have shriveled my joys
                At every step I see guns turned on me
                At every word I hear the crash of steel
                Not believing, not understanding I only stare.
                The slaughter goes on and on,
                Blood and bones and hatred all strained red.
                
                People running from the front to look out for themselves
                Cheating, lying, stabbing others in the back
                Some of my friends have fallen.
                No one knew, no one cared, they were dewdrops that’s all.
                My home will be burnt to the ground
                The way back cut off, partitioned…

            <h5>Inside Submarines<br> by Phan Nhien Hao tr. Linh Dinh</h5>
            <p>We live inside odd-shaped submarines
                chasing after secrets and the darkness of the ocean
                on a voyage toward plastic horizons
                where vague connections can never be reached
                and hopes are not deployed
                before the storm arrives and the alarm command starts
                to rouse the last illusions to stand up and put life jackets on
                looking to each other for help
                
                Once I was at the equator
                trying to slice the earth in half along the dotted line
                but someone held my hand and said:
                “If you do that, friend, water will fall into the void,
                
                and then our submarine
                won’t have any place to dive.”
                </p>
